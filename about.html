          <h2>History</h2>
          <p id="history">
            The proprietor of Cloud Tech.PH is Melvin Mallari, and he co-owns
            the company with his wife, Shinelle Ann Mallari. His line of work is
            online retail business marketing. They launched their company in the
            midst of a pandemic during the final quarter of 2020. They were
            offering gloves for bicycles back then. They purchased the supplies
            for their gloves in China and sold them on Facebook. After that,
            they started selling everyday items including shoes, clothing,
            sunglasses, watches, and a variety of other things. In actuality,
            their general product sales business has endured longer than their
            bicycle glove sales operation. They are currently selling their
            goods online and on a variety of platforms, including Facebook,
            Shopee, Lazada, and Tiktok. In June 2023, they introduced a
            brand-new product called Cone Bite Delight. It is a chocolate-filled
            ice cream cone. Since they don't yet have a physical store, they
            continue to sell online. Its firm is currently doing quite well, but
            throughout its three years of operation, things haven't always gone
            as planned. They alternate between being at the top and the bottom.
            However, that's how business is; there will always be something
            standing in your way of success. Do not let negative events ruin
            your business; instead, keep going and focus on the things that will
            help it grow.
